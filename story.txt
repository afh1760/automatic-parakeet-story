There was a parakeet, a very strange and enchanted parakeet. 
They say he wandered very far over land and sea. 
The parakeet was a little shy, and had a slight gaze of sadness, but he was very wise. 
I still remember that faithful day, the day we crossed paths...

The seas were rough and I was afraid our wooden vessel wouldn't make it that day.
Even more troubling were the dark and ominous clouds looming towards us on the horizon.
Our captain informed us that we would be heading straight into the storm and to be ready
for anything to happen. Several hours later we were in the heart of the storm. It was
total chaos as wooden pieces fell off the ship and ropes swung around. I thought it 
was rediculous that we were going to probably die all over trying to find some treasure.
Thats when out of no where the magical parakeet appeared, as if it were here to save us.

As the parakeet was singing a beautiful song, those wooden pieces started to recombine.
I watched our small vessel growing bigger and bigger and finally became a magical airship
with wing sails. The sun was out and there was no more horrible storm. Our airship took
off with cozy sea breeze as our adventure continued. And temporarily while we wait for the
continuation of the story.....

The End.
